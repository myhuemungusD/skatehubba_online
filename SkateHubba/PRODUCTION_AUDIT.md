# SkateHubba Production App Store Audit
**Date:** November 13, 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Production Review  
**Overall Readiness:** ⚠️ BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. Stripe Secret Key Security Vulnerability
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Location:** Environment variables  
**Issue:** STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is using a publishable key (pk_) instead of secret key (sk_)
```
❌ CRITICAL: Stripe key appears to be a publishable key (should start with sk_, not pk_)
   Please update STRIPE_SECRET_KEY with your secret key from Stripe Dashboard
```
**Impact:** Payments cannot be processed securely. This is a security vulnerability.  
**Fix Required:** Update STRIPE_SECRET_KEY in environment variables with actual secret key from Stripe Dashboard

---

### 2. Missing Error Boundary
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Location:** Client application root  
**Issue:** No React Error Boundary implemented  
**Impact:** Any unhandled error will show blank white screen to users instead of graceful error message  
**Fix Required:** Implement ErrorBoundary component wrapping the entire app

---

### 3. Missing Privacy Policy & Terms of Service
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL (App Store Requirement)  
**Location:** Legal pages missing  
**Issue:** Auth page mentions "Terms of Service and Privacy Policy" but these pages don't exist  
**Impact:** 
- Apple App Store: REJECTS apps without privacy policy
- Google Play Store: REJECTS apps without privacy policy  
- GDPR/CCPA compliance: REQUIRED by law
**Fix Required:** Create /privacy and /terms pages with proper legal content

---

## ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 4. Production Console Statements
**Severity:** 🟠 HIGH  
**Locations:**
- Client: 52 console.log/error/warn statements
- Server: 97 console.log/error/warn statements
- Service Worker: Multiple console.logs

**Impact:** 
- Performance overhead in production
- Exposes internal logic to users via DevTools
- Not professional for production app

**Top Offenders:**
```
client/src/lib/firebase.ts: 10 console statements
client/src/components/upload/TrickUpload.tsx: 7 console statements  
client/src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitor.ts: 6 console statements
server/routes.ts: 43 console statements
server/storage.ts: 49 console statements
```

**Fix Required:** Replace with proper logging library (pino is already installed) or remove debug logs

---

### 5. Large Bundle Size
**Severity:** 🟠 HIGH  
**Location:** dist/ folder  
**Issue:** Total build size is 141MB
**Impact:** Slower deployments, higher storage costs  
**Note:** Gzipped individual bundles are good (main: 3kb), but overall size is concerning

**Analysis:**
- Individual chunks are well-optimized (✅)
- Main bundle: 2.99kb (gzipped: 1.39kb) ✅
- Largest chunk: 103kb CSS (gzipped: 21.92kb) ✅
- Issue likely: Source maps (5.2MB map for index.js)

**Fix Required:** 
- Disable source maps in production build
- Check for unused dependencies

---

### 6. Missing App Store Metadata
**Severity:** 🟠 HIGH  
**Location:** package.json, manifest.json  
**Issue:** Missing required fields for app stores

**Missing from package.json:**
- Author information (currently empty)
- Repository URL
- Homepage URL
- Bug reporting URL

**Missing from manifest.json:**
- Screenshots (required for web app stores)
- Related applications
- IARC rating ID (for some stores)

**Fix Required:** Add complete metadata for app store submissions

---

## 📋 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 7. Accessibility Improvements Needed
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Issue:** Low usage of ARIA labels and accessibility attributes  
**Found:** Only 15 aria-label/role instances across all components  
**Impact:** Screen reader users may have difficulty navigating  
**Fix Required:** Audit all interactive elements for accessibility

---

### 8. Development Code in Production
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Location:** Various files  
**Issue:** Dev-only checks still present in code  
**Examples:**
```typescript
// client/src/index.css - has NODE_ENV check
// Multiple files check import.meta.env.DEV
```
**Fix Required:** Ensure tree-shaking removes dev code in production builds

---

### 9. Service Worker Improvements
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Location:** public/service-worker.js  
**Issues:**
- Console.logs in production SW
- Limited caching strategy (only 3 precached assets)
- No offline fallback page

**Fix Required:** 
- Remove console.logs
- Expand precache for better offline experience
- Add offline fallback page

---

### 10. SEO Sitemap Domain
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Location:** public/robots.txt  
**Issue:** Hardcoded domain "skatehubba.com"  
```
Sitemap: https://skatehubba.com/sitemap.xml
```
**Impact:** Won't work on other domains (staging, preview URLs)  
**Fix Required:** Use relative URL or environment variable
